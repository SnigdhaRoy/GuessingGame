# Guessing Game
This is a basic guessing game in python üêç

I learned how to create this guessing game from the following tutorial: https://djangocentral.com/creating-a-guessing-game-in-python/

Super basic project. Would be good to know integers, variables, strings, concatenations, printing, and some basics to know exactly what you're creating here. 

This is what the code and live run looks like when everything is set up right in an IDE: https://cloud-oj1hq7emo.vercel.app/0screen_shot_2020-10-17_at_1.36.35_am.png
